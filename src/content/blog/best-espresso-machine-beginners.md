## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a separate grinder?
Yes, for most machines. A good grinder is crucial for quality espresso. Budget around $200-300 for a decent entry-level burr grinder like the Baratza Encore ESP.

### What's the difference between semi-automatic and automatic?
Semi-automatic machines require you to start and stop the shot manually, giving you control over extraction time. Automatic machines stop the shot automatically after a preset volume.

### How much should I spend as a beginner?
Plan for $400-600 for the machine plus $200-300 for a grinder. This gets you quality equipment that will serve you well as you learn.

### Can I make good espresso with a cheaper machine?
Yes, but it requires more skill and patience. Cheaper machines often have less temperature stability and pressure consistency, making good shots harder to achieve.
