          We're coffee enthusiasts on a mission to help people make great espresso at home without the overwhelm.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Home Espresso Hub was created by coffee lovers who remember how intimidating it was to buy our first espresso machines. 
          With so many options, conflicting reviews, and technical jargon, making a confident decision felt impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started this site to be the resource we wished we had: honest reviews, practical advice, and beginner-friendly 
          guidance that cuts through the marketing hype and coffee snobbery.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Honest & Transparent:</strong> We share real pros and cons, never just the marketing highlights.</li>
          <li><strong>Beginner-Focused:</strong> We explain technical terms and prioritize ease of use.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget-Conscious:</strong> Great coffee doesn't require a $2,000 machine.</li>
          <li><strong>Practical Testing:</strong> We focus on real-world use, not just spec sheets.</li>
          <li><strong>No Gatekeeping:</strong> Everyone deserves access to good coffee at home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
